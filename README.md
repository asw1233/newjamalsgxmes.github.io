Welcome to New Jamal's Gxmes! 
I have removed the gxmes that get blocked by chrome and will try to add more games that arn't blocked.
All listed gxmes work and have been tested as of 5-16-25. 
To play a gxme, click on the one of your choice, and the find the download icon and click it.'
You will get a notification saying download complete. Double-click on it to open the gxme. 
To play the gxme later, push search, type in files, open it, go to downloads, and find the gxme of your choice and double-click on it and it will open.
The .zip file is cookie clicker. Simply open the file, then the folder, then look through until you find index.html. Then double-click on it and it will open. 
All of these work as bookmarks.
